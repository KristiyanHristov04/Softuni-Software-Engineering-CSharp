Principles For Clean HTML Code
Beautiful and clean HTML is the foundation of a beautiful website. When I teach people about CSS, I always begin by telling them that good CSS can only exist with equally good HTML markup. A house is only as strong as its foundation, right? The advantages of clean, semantic HTML are many, yet so many websites suffer from poorly written markup.
Strict DOCTYPE. If we are going to do this, let’s just do it right. No need for a discussion about whether to use HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0: both of them offer a strict version that will keep us nice and honest as we write our code.
Character set & encoding characters. In our <head> section, the very first thing should be the declaration of our character set. We’re using UTF-8 here, which is swell, but it’s listed after our <title>. Let’s go ahead and move it up so that the browser knows what character set it’s dealing with before it starts reading any content at all.
The next time you write HTML, be it a small chunk in a huge website, or the beginning of a fresh new project, just do what you can to make it right.
The interwebs will love you!
